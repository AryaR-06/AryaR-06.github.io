      <p>
        This section presents my work in CIV102, a structural engineering course taken in parallel with Praxis I. 
        It summarizes the bridge design project I completed with my team, the CTMFs that shaped our approach, 
        and how this experience contributed to my development as a student engineer.

      <p>
        The button below opens a one-pager style summary of my team's CIV102 bridge design project. 
        It outlines the design context, structural calculations, and final bridge configuration we developed in the term.
        This one-pager was created by me.

      <h1>Connection to My Position</h1>
      <p>
        Our CIV102 bridge featured a bold and innovative design—both visually distinct and structurally optimized. 
        Through iterative analysis, we arrived at a truss configuration that was theoretically among the strongest we could produce, 
        and I was proud of the creativity behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet despite our calculations, the bridge failed to pass the base load test. 
        That outcome reminded me that accuracy in engineering is not just about mathematical soundness—it’s about alignment with physical conditions. 
        The failure helped me recognize how easily small assumptions or overlooked real-world factors can undermine even a strong theoretical design. 
        This deepened my commitment to <strong>accuracy</strong>, especially in bridging the gap between modeling and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In hindsight, I also came to appreciate the importance of <strong>teamwork</strong>. 
        Working with a calm and collaborative group helped me reflect on the failure with clarity, not defensiveness. 
        That environment made it easier to learn from mistakes, and reinforced how shared support can transform a technical setback into a meaningful experience.

      <h1>CTMF 1: Measurement Matrix</h1>
      <p><strong>CTMF Type</strong>: Converging</p>
    
      <p>
        In CIV102, we applied the principles of a <strong>measurement matrix</strong> to evaluate our bridge concepts through structural calculations.
        A traditional measurement matrix assigns values to design options based on performance against criteria—typically using scoring and weighted trade-offs—
        but always includes <strong>engineering judgment</strong> to interpret results within context. We followed this standard approach:
        using <em>Y-bar</em>, <em>factor of safety</em>, and <em>failure mode predictions</em> to compare and eliminate weaker designs.
        Our calculations, drawn from a custom code we developed in Python, enabled us to classify iterations and refine geometry based on consistent performance metrics.
        Figure 7 shows three of many iterations.
      </p>

          Figure 7: Structural calculations comparing different bridge configurations using code-based evaluation. These comparisons supported final convergence decisions.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    
      <p>
        The "matrix" helped us converge on what we called a "kit-kat" style bridge—an unconventional design characterized by narrow truss spacing and layered glue joints.
        It was not the most typical choice, but it demonstrated strong theoretical strength and was validated through successive design loops.
        We selected specific bridge heights (e.g., 40 mm, 60 mm, 80 mm) not because they were optimal numerically, but because they aligned with build constraints and symmetry.
        This reflects a core feature of the measurement matrix: it guides judgment, but never replaces it.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluating this CTMF</strong>: our use of the measurement matrix gave structure to our decision-making while allowing space for creativity.
        It helped us balance quantitative analysis with subjective evaluation, enabling us to iterate intelligently rather than guess.
        However, we also learned that this technique must remain embedded within an iterative process. A matrix can only capture what is measured—
        so if the inputs are biased, or alternatives too narrow, it can prematurely lock in a weak decision.
        In our case, this risk was partially avoided by grounding the matrix in a wide set of code-evaluated iterations, but not fully resolved. 
        Had we included more parameters in our matrix, perhaps our bridge would not have failed prematurely.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This reinforced a key insight for me: <strong>innovation</strong> and <strong>convergence</strong> are not in conflict when tools are used deliberately.
        The matrix helped us transform an unconventional idea into a theoretically justified design, demonstrating that structure does not constrain creativity—it reveals where it holds up.
        Going forward, I will treat the measurement matrix as part of an cycle that involves constant iteration on designs and parameters, and engineering judgement based decisions. 
        When used early and revisited often, this tool enables engineering decisions that are both rigorous and bold.

      <h1>CTMF 2: Hoover Dam Model</h1>
      <p><strong>CTMF Type</strong>: Frame and Represent</p>
    
      <p>
        Our CIV102 bridge failed during testing—not due to member strength or buckling, but because of a stress concentration at the glue connection. 
        This failure mode was not captured in our code-based simulation, which treated members as ideal and the glue joint as a perfect interface.
        Although our model helped optimize geometry and predict performance, it was built on assumptions that proved incomplete under real-world loading.
        Figure 8 shows a CAD model of the bridge, notably without the glue joint.
      </p>
    
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/cad-bridge.png" alt="CAD Model of bridge" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid var(--accent-1);">
        <figcaption>
          Figure 8: CAD model of the final CIV102 bridge design. 
          The rendering includes detailed member geometry but omits the glue joints, which later proved to be a critical point of failure. 
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    
      <p>
        This aligns directly with the <strong>Hoover Dam</strong> model taught in ESC101 Lecture 02. 
        The model is uses the Hoover Dam as an example to frame reality into a simplifed model, 
        make decisions based on it, and apply those decisions into the real world. 
        This model never represents the world itself, but rather a simplification used to make predictions or decisions. 
        Our code applied this model, by treating members as idealized structures and the glue joint as a perfect boundary—assumptions that made the model solvable, but ultimately incomplete.
        Just as the Hoover Dam was once considered technically sound but now struggles with unanticipated outcomes such as climate-driven water shortages (Lecture 02), 
        our model was valid within its limits but blind to loads at the connection, resulting in its failure.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluating this CTMF</strong>: the failure emphasized that modeling is only one part of engineering judgment. 
        Although our model was structurally valid, it omitted the most fragile part of the build—glue failure—which ultimately governed performance.
        This revealed that any model must be tested for what it omits as well as what it includes.
        In the future, I will treat models as tools to question, not just tools to use—especially when materials or joints carry unpredictable risks.
        While simplistic modeling can be useful in the early stages of design—such as for back-of-the-envelope calculations—a late-stage model must be rigorously constructed. 
        Building accurate models that capture just the right level of detail is a skill I have not yet mastered. 
        While PHY180 introduced me to modeling in a theoretical context, this experience showed me how much more there is to learn. 
        Developing that skill is now a clear priority in my engineering education, and one I will pursue to become the best engineer I can.
      </p>      
    
      <p>
        I also recognize that this was a lapse in <strong>due diligence</strong>. 
        While glue failure modes were not discussed in course content, they are widely known in truss design literature. 
        I should have investigated potential failure points beyond the scope of what was taught. 
        This experience showed me that due diligence includes identifying what has not been covered—and proactively seeking knowledge to fill those gaps.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This reinforced my commitment to <strong>accuracy</strong>: accurate models are not just mathematically correct—they are aligned with reality. 
        That includes how structures are built, how joints behave, and where idealizations break down.
      </p>
    
      <p><strong>Models are only useful if you know what they miss.</strong></p>

      <h1>CTMF 3: Psychological Safety</h1>
      <p><strong>CTMF Type</strong>: Frame, Diverge, Converge, Represent</p>
    
      <p>
        In our CIV102 team, psychological safety played a significant role in shaping how we approached both design and failure. 
        Because I had chosen teammates I already trusted, we entered the project with a shared baseline of openness and comfort. 
        This environment allowed us to surface disagreements early, challenge assumptions without hesitation, and admit mistakes without fear of blame. 
        Our communication was efficient because critique could happen without defensiveness, and we rarely second-guessed each other's intentions.
        Figure 9 shows an image of Raihan and I gluing the bridge.
      </p>
    
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/teamwork.jpg" alt="Figure: Team members during design" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid var(--accent-1);">

      </figure>
    
      <p>
        Psychological safety directly affects how the entire design process unfolds. 
        In teams with low safety, ideas may be filtered or withheld to avoid judgment, silently narrowing the problem space or solution space.
        In contrast, our team could explore alternate truss shapes, load paths, and construction techniques without fear of “wasting time.” 
        This expanded our scope of considered options and enabled a more robust process—including various rounds of diverging and converging.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluating this CTMF</strong>: While psychological safety is not a substitute for technical judgment, it enables teams to work more effectively. 
        By reducing the interpersonal risk of being wrong, it allows more assumptions to be questioned and more ideas to surface—especially during framing and early divergence. 
        However, this level of trust cannot be assumed. I was fortunate to work with a team I already knew, but in future projects, psychological safety must be deliberately cultivated.
        I will do this by actively encouraging feedback, acknowledging uncertainty, and ensuring that critique is directed at ideas—not individuals. 
        Team based design happens socially as much as it does cognitively, and safety is the condition that allows that process to be honest and complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        This CTMF strengthened my appreciation for <strong>teamwork</strong> as a condition for accurate, innovative, and iterative design. 
        When trust is present, it becomes easier to challenge each other's assumptions, take creative risks, and recover from failure. 
        In hindsight, our team's safety was not just a benefit—it was a quiet enabler of the very values that shaped my engineering approach.
      </p>

    <section id="reflection">
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        CIV102 deepened my understanding of what it means to evaluate a design—not just by its calculations, but by its ability to hold up in the real world. 
        Even though our bridge was analytically sound, it failed due to an overlooked detail: the glue joint. 
        That outcome reinforced my commitment to <strong>accuracy</strong> as something that extends beyond equations, requiring close attention to real-world behavior, construction limits, and failure modes.
      </p>
      <p>
        What allowed me to grow from the experience was <strong>teamwork</strong>. 
        Our psychologically safe environment gave us the space to reflect without defensiveness, to learn without blame, and to work toward better design despite the outcome. 
        Those habits shaped how I now approach technical collaboration—and I carry them forward with clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next section explores Praxis II, where I applied my lessons from semester 1 and developed new ones. 
        While the project was more open-ended and centered on user experience, the mindset I had built, incuding my values, remained important in my work.
