      <h1>Connection to My Position</h1>
      <p>
        During Praxis I, I learned how easily a design can fail when it is built on unspoken assumptions. 
        Our team believed we had defined the problem thoroughly, but during our Alpha presentation, 
        the examiner challenged us on a missing requirement: what does it actually mean to “solve” the Splartz? 
        We had assumed the meaning was self-evident, but it was never defined or included in our framing.
        That moment shaped my early commitment to <strong>accuracy</strong>—to define the problem as clearly as the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned the value of <strong>innovation</strong> in Praxis I, when my team explored both hydraulic and pneumatic designs (water and air based pump systems). 
        By not locking in a design too early, and expanding on what we had, we were able to develop a better design. It was also a form of <strong>iteration</strong>, 
        even though I had not named it that at the time. Looking back, this open-ended exploration reflected the very habits I now see as essential to good engineering design.
      </p>

    <section id="reframing">
      <h1>CTMF 1: Reframing</h1>
      <p><strong>CTMF Type</strong>: Framing</p>
    
      <p>
        While reflecting on our missed requirement in Alpha, I realized how our early understanding of the problem had been shaped by another team's original design brief. 
        Although we reframed their version to clarify goals and scope (shown in red), we did not formally challenge the assumptions embedded in the original framing. 
        As a result, we overlooked a key requirement: defining what it actually meant to “solve” the Splartz. 
        That requirement was only added later (in blue), after it was brought to our attention by the examiner. Figure 3 shows the added requirement.
      </p>
    
      <figure>

        <figcaption>
          Figure 3: Printed design brief that was used for Alpha. Black text is from the original team's version. Red text shows our team's reframing work. 
          Blue pen marks the missing requirement we added after feedback from the Alpha presentation. Right image is a close-up of the new requirement. 
          A higher quality image was not available.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    
      <p>
        This experience showed me that reframing is not just about adjusting scope or formatting a brief—it is about actively interrogating the logic and assumptions underlying a problem statement. 
        Our reframing helped us clarify the original team's intent, but because we failed to question certain implied goals, we missed the ambiguity behind “solving the Splartz.” 
        The danger of assumptions lies in their invisibility: they can exclude entire requirements while making a design seem complete.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        I now view reframing as an ongoing design activity that is essential in two key moments: immediately after receiving a problem statement (especially if inherited), 
        and again during requirement development. In both stages, reframing must include explicit efforts to surface assumptions, definitions, and dependencies that might otherwise remain implicit.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluating this CTMF</strong>: our reframing provided helpful structure, but it was incomplete. 
        We organized the problem effectively, but did not interrogate its foundational definitions. 
        In future work, I will use reframing not only to align on goals, but also to uncover potential blind spots caused by unchallenged assumptions.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This experience strengthened my understanding of <strong>accuracy</strong> as a design value. 
        Precision is not just about numbers—it begins with how the problem is framed. 
        Reframing is now a method I will use to build that precision from the start.
      </p>
    
      <p><strong>Always reframe—even when the problem seems clear.</strong></p>

      <h1>CTMF 2: Due Diligence</h1>
      <p><strong>CTMF Type</strong>: Frame, Diverge, Converge, Represent</p>
      <p>
        In Praxis I, our team worked from a framing document provided by another group, and while we refined the scope and goals, 
        we did not question the underlying assumptions. As discussed earlier, this oversight led to a missing requirement during Alpha—
        an error that originated from trusting that the prior team's framing was complete. At the time, we believed we were building responsibly on previous work, 
        but in hindsight, we had failed to conduct proper due diligence on what we inherited. 
        Figure 4 shows a design calculation that informed the missed requirement—
        a due diligence that should have taken place much earlier in the process than it actually did
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>
          Figure 4: A design calculation estimating the minimum leg length discrepancy needed to perceive chair wobble (1.25 mm). 
          This calculation supported a late-stage requirement during Alpha and highlighted a gap in our framing process. 
          It should have been developed earlier, reinforcing the need for proactive reframing and early assumption checks.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>Due diligence</strong>, as introduced in ESC102 Lecture 05, is the professional responsibility to independently verify the information you rely on—especially when that information 
        is supplied by others. It is not a sign of mistrust; rather, it is a recognition that even well-intentioned work can carry forward implicit gaps or outdated context. 
        Lecture 05 frames due diligence as a personal and professional obligation: a way of ensuring both individual integrity and respect for stakeholders, especially when operating 
        within a larger community or project.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluating this CTMF</strong>: I see now that due diligence should have guided our early work on the problem statement. 
        We accepted the prior team's assumptions without independently checking them, and that decision had direct consequences on our design's clarity. 
        Going forward, I will apply this CTMF by validating design inputs, reviewing inherited materials critically, and raising questions about any part of a design 
        I did not contribute to directly. 
        If I am creating work independently from the ground up, 
        I will ensure due diligence by researching thoroughly and checking biases and assumptions often.
        Having these processes in place will ensure my work always of a high standard, meeting my responsibility to the world.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        For me, due diligence is now a safeguard for my value of <strong>accuracy</strong>—
        it prevents me from treating prior work as fact and ensures that every assumption, source, and definition has earned its place in the design. 
        This kind of verification is not just a task; it is a mindset I intend to carry into every future engineering decision, 
        especially when stakes are high or problems are inherited.
      </p>
    
      <p><strong>Always verify—especially when the source seems trustworthy.</strong></p>

      <h1>CTMF 3: "Parallel Ideas" (Osborn Checklist)</h1>
      <p><strong>CTMF Type</strong>: Diverging</p>
    
      <p>
        In Praxis I, we developed a method we called <em>parallel ideas</em>: after generating a wide range of concepts using tools like biomimicry and SCAMPER, 
        we used the <strong>Osborn Checklist</strong> to systematically expand on those ideas. This allowed us to push promising directions further, without prematurely narrowing in.
        Figure 5 shows biomimicry and SCAMPER, while Figure 6 shows "parallel ideas."
      </p>  
      <figure>

          (right), demonstrating parallel ideas. Annotated with text for readability
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        As outlined in ESC101's "17 Diverging Tools" resource, the Osborn Checklist is a set of prompts that help designers transform existing ideas 
        by asking questions like “What can be substituted?”, “What else is like this?”, or “What can be magnified or modified?”. Rather than using it on random concepts, 
        we applied it to ideas produced through structured divergence—ensuring that we started from a broad foundation before deepening specific solutions.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Evaluating this CTMF</strong>: our use of parallel ideas helped balance creativity with structure. Applying the Osborn Checklist after initial divergence 
        ensured that we didn't converge too early, while still building momentum. However, we also learned that this technique must follow—not replace—true divergence. 
        Parallel ideas are not a substitute for coming up with a wide range of ideas; they must complement this approach. 
        Otherwise, we run the risk of not exploring the desing space enough, which can leave potential solutions unconsidered.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In future projects, I plan to reserve time for this exact sequence: use wide-reaching idea generation tools first, then follow with Osborn-style transformations. 
        This separation of <strong>generating</strong> and <strong>expanding</strong> ideas gives teams space to explore without losing depth.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This CTMF also strengthened my appreciation for <strong>innovation</strong> as a value. It showed me that creativity is not just about the number of ideas you generate, 
        but about how thoroughly you explore and refine them before making decisions. 
      </p>

    <section id="reflection">
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        Praxis I taught me that strong engineering begins with how problems are framed. I saw firsthand how missing a requirement could arise not from technical error, 
        but from unspoken assumptions. That moment shaped my understanding of <strong>accuracy</strong>—not just in execution, but in identifying what the design must achieve. 
        I also began to recognize the role of <strong>innovation</strong> and <strong>iteration</strong> in my work, especially through our structured exploration of divergent ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was taking CIV102 in parallel with this project, and it offered a valuable contrast: even in more analytical domains like bridge design, 
        I found myself learning similar lessons—lessons about the importance of my core values. 
        The next section explores those lessons in more depth. 
        Together, these experiences built the foundation for the habits I now rely on to meet my responsibility as an engineer.
