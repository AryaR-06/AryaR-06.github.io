      <h1>Position</h1> 
      <p>
        This section presents my original engineering design position, how it evolved over the term, and why I chose to present this portfolio as a website.  
        The justification for this position appears throughout the portfolio, grounded in the design work and reflections from my first-year engineering projects.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section id="original-position">
      <h1>My Original Position</h1> 
      <p>
        In my position statement, I defined <strong>engineering design</strong> as:
        <div class="quote">The creative application of advanced knowledge in math and science to solve real-world problems.</div>
      </p>
      <p>
        I viewed engineering design as a subset of engineering, focused on producing functional solutions under constraints, and ultimately making decisions and recommending designs.
        I believed that engineers hold a privileged position due to their technical expertise, and that they have a responsibility to improve the existing state of the world.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section id="original-position-values">
      <h2>My Values</h2>
      <p>
        To fulfill this responsibility, I personally prioritized two values throughout the engineering process: <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>.
        Accuracy mattered because engineering decisions have can real consequences if done incorrectly.
        Innovation mattered because pushing the boundaries of what is possible felt like the best use of my skills.

      <h1>Iterated Position</h1>
      <p>
        This section presents my current engineering position after completing Praxis II.
        My current position builds on my original definition of engineering design, and still emphasizes producing functional solutions under real constraints.
        My core values of accuracy and innovation remain central to how I define good engineering work.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section id="iterated-position-evolution">
      <h2>Design Experience and Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        My original position was shaped by my early design experiences in Praxis I and CIV102.
        I carried that position into Praxis II, where I was challenged to apply it in a more complex design environment.
        That experience prompted me to expand my position based on what I learned.
      </p>
    </section>
  
    <section id="iterated-position-expansion">
      <h2>Expanded Priorities</h2>
      <p>
        Through Praxis II, I gained clarity on the responsibilities of engineers in practice—especially the importance of iteration, learning, and teamwork.
        I now place greater emphasis on three additional priorities: continuous <strong>iteration</strong>, continuous <strong>learning</strong>, and <strong>teamwork</strong>.
        Working on a technical design for real stakeholders showed me that design ideas must evolve through structured feedback and testing to be the most effective.
        I also recognized the importance of collaboration in navigating constraints, generating solutions, and achieving outcomes that would not have been possible on my own.
        Finally, I learned that engineering is a learning process—not just through reflection and revision, but also through acquiring new technical skills during design work.
        By learning more I expand what I am capable of contributing—enabling me to deliver better, more impactful solutions.  
        These additions do not replace my original position; rather, they expand upon it.
      </p>

    <section id="iterated-position-visual">
      <h2>Visual Representation</h2>
      <p>
        Figure 2 provides a visual summary of my revised position. 
        While it is meant to be similar to Figure 1, I modified the formatting to reflect my position with more clarity.
      </p>

    </section>
  
    <section id="iterated-position-summary">
      <h2>Summary and Framing</h2>
      <p>
        My original position was shaped by Praxis I and CIV102, while the additions—iteration, learning, and teamwork—emerged through reflection on my Praxis II experience.
        While iteration, learning, and teamwork were already present in my work, they were not consciously emphasized until Praxis II made their importance clear.
        The CTMFs selected in each project highlight key aspects of my position and help explain how it developed over time.
        Together, they frame this portfolio and serve as evidence of my growth as a designer.
        These ideas now shape how I think about design, and the sections that follow show how this position developed through experience.
      </p>      
    </section>
  
    <section id="portfolio-website">
      <h1>Portfolio as a Website</h1>
      <p>
        I chose to present this portfolio as a website because it directly supports my values of <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>.
        With no prior experience in web development, I treated this as an engineering opportunity—learning the necessary tools and workflows as part of the design process itself.
        This allowed me to develop new technical skills while creating a format that is structured, interactive, and adaptable.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I also viewed presentation as a design challenge: an opportunity to apply my engineering values beyond the project work itself.
        Choosing a website allowed me to treat communication not as an afterthought, but as a deliberate solution—one that emphasizes clarity, structure, and accessibility.
        In doing so, I applied some key principles I value in design—<strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>iteration</strong>—to how I communicate design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a format that benefits both the reader and myself, as the primary stakeholder. 
        It is also forward-looking, as I intend to continue updating and using this platform to showcase future engineering work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next section is Praxis I, where the early stages of my design learning are documented in context.
